#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concepts 
The user re-register their priviously learnt theoreticaal concepts by seeing it visually and by their working along with experiment. 

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Describe the concept of Armstrong Numbers <br>  | Understand | Describe
2.| User will be able to: <br>Apply different C programming constructs to write the program | Apply | Apply
3.| User will be able to: <br>Apply the loop controls to find out Armstrong number between 1 to 100  | Apply | Apply

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to  <br> Describe the concept of Armstrong Numbers  | On the simulator screen,  <br> student able to see the mathamatical formula used to calculate the armstrong number  | Q1. Which of the following is Armstrong Number?<br> <b>a.153</b> &emsp;b. 121&emsp;c. 119&emsp;d. 1234 
2.| User will be able to  <br> Apply different C programming constructs to write the program  | On the simulator screen,  <br> student able to click on next button to see change in color and position of pointer when different conditional statements get excutes | Q1. If statement works like "If condition is met, then execute the task". <b>True</b> or False?
3.| User will be able to <br> Apply the loop controls to find out Armstrong number between 1 to 100| student able to click on next button <br>to see the change in color and position of pointer when loop get excutes | Q1. Loops in C Language are implemented using? <br> A.While Block&emsp; B.For Block &emsp; C.Do While Block &emsp;<b> D.All the above</b> <br> Q2. Choose a right C Statement.<br> A.Loops or Repetition block executes a group of statements repeatedly.&emsp;B.Loop is usually executed as long as a condition is met.&emsp;C.Loops usually take advantage of Loop Counter&emsp;<b>D.All the above.</b>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Click on Simulate button| The simulator will give visual dispaly of formula and example for calculation of Armstrong Numbers | To understand logic behind calculation of Armstrong Numbers
2.| Click on Simulate button | The simulator will highlight the line in the loop which are getting executed | To see how code is started with predefined inputs.
3.| Click on Next button | The simulator will highlight the lines which are getting excuted and disply the Armstrong Numbers  | To see how the results are getting displayed according to calculation which is described in the code.
4.| Click on Next button | The simulator will highlight the lines which are getting excuted and finally disply the list of Armstrong Numbers between 1 to 100 | To see final result that is list of Armstrong numbers between 1 to 100 .
